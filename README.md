## This is a Data Structures in Javascript Challenge.

This is a **30 Day Data Structure challenge** where I will dive into the intricancies of data structures
using Javascript as the language of choice. I will show up every day and push code with the aim of 
covering DS in depth. The major resources that I will be using for this challenge include [Free code camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#es6) [trekhleb Work on data strucutres](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms), [Hacker Rank](www.hackerrank.com), [Interview Bit](www.interviewbit.com) [Geeksforgeeks](www.geeksforgeeks.org) [Okso for diagrams](https://okso.app/) among other resources.

Lets catch up on [X](https://x.com/koomekelvink) or [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/koome-kelvin/)

## The end goal is to be able to crack any Javascript coding challenge as well as elevate problem solving skills
